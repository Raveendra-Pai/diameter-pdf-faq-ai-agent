# diameter-pdf-faq-ai-agent
This project is a local AI documentation assistant for the Diameter protocol specification (PDF). It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to search relevant sections from the PDF using Chroma + FastEmbed, and generates accurate answers using Mistral running on Ollama. It also supports a scalable MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture
